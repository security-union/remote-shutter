Hi App Review team:

Please follow the next video to locate the AppTrackTransparency permission request.

Notice that you will need 2 iOS devices to pair them and get to the remote screen where we show the permission request

3.1: 
Bug fixes, no UI changes, now the slider value is persisted.

3.0:

New wizard to guide the user to connect the devices.

AppTrackTransparency video attached to this message.

2.6:

Now pictures are taken in the max available resolution.

Please note that the attached video is from version 2.5, but we did not touch the UI.


2.5 Notes:
We just added Mac Catalyst/Big Sur support, let us know what you think.


In order to test this app, you require two devices, one to act as the remote shutter and the other one to act as the camera.

We use Google Ad Mob, that is why IDFA is checked.

You can take photos and videos from the camera using the monitor device.

Please find attached a video of how the consent prompt looks like.It shows up after the user pairs her/his phone and selects the remote icon.
