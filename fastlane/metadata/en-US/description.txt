Remote Shutter is an application that requires two devices. It works on both macOS and iOS. 

With Remote Shutter one of your devices is the camera remote or camera monitor, and the other device would be set up wherever you would like to take a picture as the camera. Using the connected phone you can take pictures from up to 50 feet away.

Remote Shutter makes it easy to take pictures of things at weird angles and that would put you in an uncomfortable position. Take Remote Shutter for a spin for free!

Features:
- Take pictures from up to 50ft away

1. Connect your devices
2. Choose which role the device has (camera or remote)
3. Set up & take pictures!
